- Automate software production from spec to a ready app in limited domains.
- Optimize for AI use: Graph-based structure for parallelism and probabilistic analysis.
- Ensure reproducibility, security, and scalability in distributed environments.
- Support the vision of AI agents that generate code efficiently without human-like abstractions.
