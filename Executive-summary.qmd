Our vision for CAI (Cognitive AI Language) is to create a programming language purely optimized for artificial intelligence, enabling fully automated software production. A human provides a verbal specification (spec), and the AI generates graph-based code to produce a complete application â€“ including code, UI, data models, databases, and deployment to the cloud quickly. CAI is not designed for humans but for AI's strengths: massive parallelism, probabilistic computation, automatic optimization, and ML integrations. This represents the future where AI agents evolve into autonomous software engineers, replacing traditional languages with efficient, graph-based structures. The plan emphasizes excellent performance, low-level control, and scalability, limiting the MVP to backend services and ML pipelines, but expanding modularly to UI and other features.
